* Validate to ensure IDs are unique throughout
* Update timestamps on all the sitemaps
* Push it all through a lint or prettifier to fix up Narbeh's hinky indenting
* Attribution use case in ecommerce-solutions.html looks weird
* Narbeh to sort out the ecommerce-solutions.html `id="service"` thing, which seems to be keyed to #service but IDs should be unique. Font sizes in the div are all fucked up too.
